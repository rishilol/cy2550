[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mgpg  [22mis the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool
       to provide digital encryption and signing services  using  the  OpenPGP
       standard.  [1mgpg  [22mfeatures  complete key management and all the bells and
       whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.

       There are two main versions of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG  2.x.   GnuPG
       2.x  supports modern encryption algorithms and thus should be preferred
       over GnuPG 1.x.  You only need  to  use  GnuPG  1.x  if  your  platform
       doesn't  support  GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features that
       GnuPG 2.x has deprecated, e.g.,  decrypting  data  created  with  PGP-2
       keys.

       If  you  are  looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version
       installed under the name [1mgpg1[22m.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       The program returns 0 if there are no severe errors, 1 if  at  least  a
       signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

       Note  that  signature verification requires exact knowledge of what has
       been signed and by whom it has been signed.  Using only the return code
       is thus not an appropriate way to verify a signature by a script.   Ei‐
       ther make proper use or the status codes or use the [1mgpgv [22mtool which has
       been designed to make signature verification easy for scripts.

[1mWARNINGS[0m
       Use  a good password for your user account and make sure that all secu‐
       rity issues are always fixed on your  machine.   Also  employ  diligent
       physical protection to your machine.  Consider to use a good passphrase
       as a last resort protection to your secret key in the case your machine
       gets  stolen.   It  is  important that your secret key is never leaked.
       Using an easy to carry around token or smartcard with the secret key is
       often a advisable.

       If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the pro‐
       gram knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line  or
       use ‘-’ to specify STDIN.

       For  scripted  or  other unattended use of [1mgpg [22mmake sure to use the ma‐
       chine-parseable interface and not the default interface  which  is  in‐
       tended  for direct use by humans.  The machine-parseable interface pro‐
       vides a stable and well documented API independent of the locale or fu‐
       ture changes of [1mgpg[22m.  To enable this interface use the options  [1m--with-[0m
       [1mcolons [22mand [1m--status-fd[22m.  For certain operations the option [1m--command-fd[0m
       may  come  handy too.  See this man page and the file ‘[4mDETAILS[24m’ for the
       specification of the interface.  Note that the GnuPG ``info'' pages  as
       well as the PDF version of the GnuPG manual features a chapter on unat‐
       tended  use  of GnuPG.  As an alternative the library [1mGPGME [22mcan be used
       as a high-level abstraction on top of that interface.

[1mINTEROPERABILITY[0m
       GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the  OpenPGP  stan‐
       dard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of the
       standard,  such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression
       algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all  OpenPGP  programs
       implement  these  optional algorithms and that by forcing their use via
       the [1m--cipher-algo[22m, [1m--digest-algo[22m,  [1m--cert-digest-algo[22m,  or  [1m--compress-[0m
       [1malgo  [22moptions  in  GnuPG,  it  is  possible to create a perfectly valid
       OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the intended recipient.

       There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and  each
       supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms.  For
       example,  until  recently,  no  (unhacked) version of PGP supported the
       BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be
       read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP prefer‐
       ences system that will always do the right thing  and  create  messages
       that  are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP program
       they use. Only override this safe default if you really know  what  you
       are doing.

       If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences
       on  a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off us‐
       ing the [1m--pgp6[22m, [1m--pgp7[22m, or [1m--pgp8 [22moptions. These options  are  safe  as
       they  do  not  force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP,
       but rather reduce the available algorithms to a "PGP-safe" list.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       Commands are not distinguished from options except for  the  fact  that
       only  one  command  is allowed.  Generally speaking, irrelevant options
       are silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.

       [1mgpg [22mmay be run with no commands. In this case it will print  a  warning
       perform  a  reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given
       as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a
       file containing keys is listed, etc.).

       If you run into any problems, please add the option  [1m--verbose  [22mto  the
       invocation to see more diagnostics.

   [1mCommands not specific to the function[0m

       [1m--version[0m
              Print  the program version and licensing information.  Note that
              you cannot abbreviate this command.

       [1m--help[0m
       [1m-h     [22mPrint a usage message summarizing the most  useful  command-line
              options.   Note that you cannot arbitrarily abbreviate this com‐
              mand (though you can use its short form [1m-h[22m).

       [1m--warranty[0m
              Print warranty information.

       [1m--dump-options[0m
              Print a list of all available options and commands.   Note  that
              you cannot abbreviate this command.

   [1mCommands to select the type of operation[0m

       [1m--sign[0m
       [1m-s     [22mSign  a message. This command may be combined with [1m--encrypt [22m(to
              sign and encrypt a message), [1m--symmetric [22m(to sign and  symmetri‐
              cally  encrypt a message), or both [1m--encrypt [22mand [1m--symmetric [22m(to
              sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a  secret
              key  or  a passphrase).  The signing key is chosen by default or
              can be set explicitly using the [1m--local-user  [22mand  [1m--default-key[0m
              options.

       [1m--clear-sign[0m
       [1m--clearsign[0m
              Make  a  cleartext signature.  The content in a cleartext signa‐
              ture is readable without any special software. OpenPGP  software
              is  only  needed  to verify the signature.  cleartext signatures
              may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence  and
              are not intended to be reversible.  The signing key is chosen by
              default  or  can  be  set  explicitly using the [1m--local-user [22mand
              [1m--default-key [22moptions.

       [1m--detach-sign[0m
       [1m-b     [22mMake a detached signature.

       [1m--encrypt[0m
       [1m-e     [22mEncrypt data to one or more public keys.  This  command  may  be
              combined  with [1m--sign [22m(to sign and encrypt a message), [1m--symmet‐[0m
              [1mric [22m(to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using  a  secret
              key  or a passphrase), or [1m--sign [22mand [1m--symmetric [22mtogether (for a
              signed message that can be decrypted using a  secret  key  or  a
              passphrase).  [1m--recipient [22mand related options specify which pub‐
              lic keys to use for encryption.

       [1m--symmetric[0m
       [1m-c     [22mEncrypt  with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default
              symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may  be  chosen  with  the
              [1m--cipher-algo  [22moption.  This command may be combined with [1m--sign[0m
              (for a signed and symmetrically  encrypted  message),  [1m--encrypt[0m
              (for  a  message  that  may  be  decrypted via a secret key or a
              passphrase), or [1m--sign [22mand [1m--encrypt [22mtogether (for a signed mes‐
              sage that may be decrypted via a secret key  or  a  passphrase).
              [1mgpg  [22mcaches the passphrase used for symmetric encryption so that
              a decrypt operation may not require that the user needs to enter
              the passphrase.  The option [1m--no-symkey-cache  [22mcan  be  used  to
              disable this feature.

       [1m--store[0m
              Store only (make a simple literal data packet).

       [1m--decrypt[0m
       [1m-d     [22mDecrypt  the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file
              is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with
              [1m--output[22m). If the decrypted file is  signed,  the  signature  is
              also  verified. This command differs from the default operation,
              as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file
              and it rejects files that don't begin with an encrypted message.

       [1m--verify[0m
              Assume that the first argument is a signed file  and  verify  it
              without generating any output.  With no arguments, the signature
              packet  is  read from STDIN.  If only one argument is given, the
              specified file is expected to include a complete signature.

              With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a
              file with a detached signature and the  remaining  files  should
              contain the signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use
              ‘-’  as  the  second filename.  For security reasons, a detached
              signature will not read the signed material from  STDIN  if  not
              explicitly specified.

              Note:  If  the option [1m--batch [22mis not used, [1mgpg [22mmay assume that a
              single argument is a file with a detached signature, and it will
              try to find a matching data file by stripping certain  suffixes.
              Using  this historical feature to verify a detached signature is
              strongly discouraged; you should always specify  the  data  file
              explicitly.

              Note:  When  verifying  a cleartext signature, [1mgpg [22mverifies only
              what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any  extra  data
              outside  of the cleartext signature or the header lines directly
              following the dash marker line.  The option [1m--output [22mmay be used
              to write out the actual signed data, but there  are  other  pit‐
              falls with this format as well.  It is suggested to avoid clear‐
              text signatures in favor of detached signatures.

              Note:  To  check  whether a file was signed by a certain key the
              option [1m--assert-signer [22mcan be used.  As an alternative the  [1mgpgv[0m
              tool  can  be  used.   [1mgpgv  [22mis  designed to compare signed data
              against a list of trusted keys and returns with success only for
              a good signature.  It has its own manual page.

       [1m--multifile[0m
              This modifies certain other commands to  accept  multiple  files
              for  processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each
              filename on a separate line. This allows for many  files  to  be
              processed  at once. [1m--multifile [22mmay currently be used along with
              [1m--verify[22m, [1m--encrypt[22m, and [1m--decrypt[22m. Note that [1m--multifile --ver‐[0m
              [1mify [22mmay not be used with detached signatures.

       [1m--verify-files[0m
              Identical to [1m--multifile --verify[22m.

       [1m--encrypt-files[0m
              Identical to [1m--multifile --encrypt[22m.

       [1m--decrypt-files[0m
              Identical to [1m--multifile --decrypt[22m.

       [1m--list-keys[0m
       [1m-k[0m
       [1m--list-public-keys[0m
              List the specified keys.  If no keys  are  specified,  then  all
              keys from the configured public keyrings are listed.

              Never  use  the  output of this command in scripts or other pro‐
              grams.  The output is intended only for humans and its format is
              likely to change.  The [1m--with-colons [22moption emits the output  in
              a stable, machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by
              scripts and other programs.

       [1m--list-secret-keys[0m
       [1m-K     [22mList  the specified secret keys.  If no keys are specified, then
              all known secret keys are listed.  A [1m# [22mafter  the  initial  tags
              [1msec  [22mor [1mssb [22mmeans that the secret key or subkey is currently not
              usable.  We also say that this key has been taken  offline  (for
              example, a primary key can be taken offline by exporting the key
              using  the  command  [1m--export-secret-subkeys[22m).   A [1m> [22mafter these
              tags indicate that the key is stored on a smartcard.   See  also
              [1m--list-keys[22m.

       [1m--check-signatures[0m
       [1m--check-sigs[0m
              Same  as  [1m--list-keys[22m,  but  the key signatures are verified and
              listed too.  Note that for performance  reasons  the  revocation
              status of a signing key is not shown.  This command has the same
              effect as using [1m--list-keys [22mwith [1m--with-sig-check[22m.

              The  status  of the verification is indicated by a flag directly
              following the "sig" tag (and thus before the flags described be‐
              low.  A "!" indicates that the signature has  been  successfully
              verified,  a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is used if an
              error occurred while checking the signature  (e.g.  a  non  sup‐
              ported  algorithm).   Signatures  where  the  public  key is not
              available are not  listed;  to  see  their  keyids  the  command
              [1m--list-sigs [22mcan be used.

              For  each  signature  listed, there are several flags in between
              the signature status flag and keyid.   These  flags  give  addi‐
              tional  information  about  each  key  signature.   From left to
              right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see
              [1m--ask-cert-level[22m), "L" for a local or  non-exportable  signature
              (see  [1m--lsign-key[22m),  "R"  for  a nonRevocable signature (see the
              [1m--edit-key [22mcommand "nrsign"), "P" for a signature that  contains
              a  policy  URL (see [1m--cert-policy-url[22m), "N" for a signature that
              contains a notation (see [1m--cert-notation[22m), "X"  for  an  eXpired
              signature  (see  [1m--ask-cert-expire[22m),  and the numbers 1-9 or "T"
              for 10 and above to indicate trust  signature  levels  (see  the
              [1m--edit-key [22mcommand "tsign").

       [1m--locate-keys[0m
       [1m--locate-external-keys[0m
              Locate the keys given as arguments.  This command basically uses
              the same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption and
              may  thus be used to see what keys [1mgpg [22mmight use.  In particular
              external methods as defined by [1m--auto-key-locate [22mare used to lo‐
              cate a key if the arguments comain valid mail  addresses.   Only
              public keys are listed.

              The  variant  [1m--locate-external-keys [22mdoes not consider a locally
              existing key and can thus be used to force the refresh of a  key
              via the defined external methods.  If a fingerprint is given and
              and   the  methods  defined  by  --auto-key-locate  define  LDAP
              servers, the key is fetched from these resources;  defined  non-
              LDAP keyservers are skipped.

       [1m--show-keys[0m
              This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints information
              about  them in the same way the command [1m--list-keys [22mdoes for lo‐
              cally stored key.  In addition the list  options  [1mshow-unusable-[0m
              [1muids[22m, [1mshow-unusable-subkeys[22m, [1mshow-notations [22mand [1mshow-policy-urls[0m
              are  also enabled.  As usual for automated processing, this com‐
              mand should be combined with the option [1m--with-colons[22m.

       [1m--fingerprint[0m
              List all keys (or the specified ones) along with  their  finger‐
              prints.  This is the same output as [1m--list-keys [22mbut with the ad‐
              ditional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be com‐
              bined with [1m--check-signatures[22m.  If this command is given  twice,
              the  fingerprints  of  all  secondary keys are listed too.  This
              command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid
              format has been set to "none".

       [1m--list-packets[0m
              List only the sequence of packets.  This command is only  useful
              for  debugging.   When used with option [1m--verbose [22mthe actual MPI
              values are dumped and not only their  lengths.   Note  that  the
              output of this command may change with new releases.

       [1m--edit-card[0m
       [1m--card-edit[0m
              Present  a  menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help"
              provides an overview on available commands. For a  detailed  de‐
              scription,  please see the Card HOWTO at https://gnupg.org/docu‐
              mentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .  Please  note  that  the
              command  "openpgp" can be used to switch to the OpenPGP applica‐
              tion of cards which by default are presenting  another  applica‐
              tion (e.g. PIV).

       [1m--card-status[0m
              Show the content of the smart card.

       [1m--change-pin[0m
              Present  a  menu  to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This
              functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd"  with
              the [1m--edit-card [22mcommand.

       [1m--delete-keys [4m[22mname[0m
              Remove  key  from the public keyring. In batch mode either [1m--yes[0m
              is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is
              a safeguard against accidental deletion of  multiple  keys.   If
              the  exclamation  mark  syntax is used with the fingerprint of a
              subkey only that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation  mark  is
              used  with  the fingerprint of the primary key the entire public
              key is deleted.

       [1m--delete-secret-keys [4m[22mname[0m
              Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the  key  must
              be  specified  by  fingerprint.  The option [1m--yes [22mcan be used to
              advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.  This extra pre-
              caution is done because [1mgpg [22mcan't be sure that  the  secret  key
              (as  controlled by gpg-agent) is only used for the given OpenPGP
              public key.  If the exclamation mark syntax  is  used  with  the
              fingerprint  of  a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is
              deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of
              the primary key only the secret  part  of  the  primary  key  is
              deleted.

       [1m--delete-secret-and-public-key [4m[22mname[0m
              Same as [1m--delete-key[22m, but if a secret key exists, it will be re‐
              moved  first. In batch mode the key must be specified by finger‐
              print.  The option [1m--yes [22mcan be used to advise gpg-agent not  to
              request a confirmation.

       [1m--export[0m
              Either  export  all  keys from all keyrings (default keyring and
              those registered via option [1m--keyring[22m), or if at least one  name
              is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are written
              to  STDOUT  or  to the file given with option [1m--output[22m.  Use to‐
              gether with [1m--armor [22mto mail those keys.

       [1m--send-keys [4m[22mkeyIDs[0m
              Similar to [1m--export [22mbut sends the keys to a keyserver.   Finger‐
              prints may be used instead of key IDs.  Don't send your complete
              keyring  to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new
              or changed by you.  If no [4mkeyIDs[24m are given, [1mgpg [22mdoes nothing.

              Take care: Keyservers are by design write only systems and  thus
              it  is not possible to ever delete keys once they have been send
              to a keyserver.

       [1m--export-secret-keys[0m
       [1m--export-secret-subkeys[0m
              Same as [1m--export[22m, but exports the secret keys instead.  The  ex‐
              ported  keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with op‐
              tion [1m--output[22m.  This command is often used along with the option
              [1m--armor [22mto allow for easy printing of the key for paper  backup;
              however the external tool [1mpaperkey [22mdoes a better job of creating
              backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be a se‐
              curity risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure chan‐
              nel.

              The  second form of the command has the special property to ren‐
              der the secret part of the primary key useless; this  is  a  GNU
              extension  to  OpenPGP  and other implementations can not be ex‐
              pected to successfully import such a key.  Its intended  use  is
              in  generating a full key with an additional signing subkey on a
              dedicated machine.  This command then exports  the  key  without
              the primary key to the main machine.

              GnuPG  may ask you to enter the passphrase for the key.  This is
              required, because the internal protection method of  the  secret
              key is different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.

       [1m--export-ssh-key[0m
              This  command  is used to export a key in the OpenSSH public key
              format.  It requires the specification of one key by  the  usual
              means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an authenti‐
              cation  capability  to  STDOUT  or to the file given with option
              [1m--output[22m.  That output can directly be added  to  ssh's  ‘[4mautho‐[0m
              [4mrized_key[24m’ file.

              By  specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint
              suffixed with an exclamation mark (!), a specific subkey or  the
              primary  key  can  be exported.  This does not even require that
              the key has the authentication capability flag set.

       [1m--import[0m
       [1m--fast-import[0m
              Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring.  The
              fast version is currently just a synonym.

              There  are  a  few  other options which control how this command
              works.  Most notable here is the [1m--import-options merge-only [22mop‐
              tion which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of
              new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.

       [1m--receive-keys [4m[22mkeyIDs[0m
       [1m--recv-keys [4m[22mkeyIDs[0m
              Import the keys with the given [4mkeyIDs[24m from a keyserver.

       [1m--refresh-keys[0m
              Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist  on
              the  local  keyring.  This is useful for updating a key with the
              latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments
              will refresh the entire keyring.

       [1m--search-keys [4m[22mnames[0m
              Search the keyserver for the given [4mnames[24m. Multiple  names  given
              here will be joined together to create the search string for the
              keyserver.  Note that keyservers search for [4mnames[24m in a different
              and simpler way than gpg does.  The best choice is to use a mail
              address.   Due  to  data privacy reasons keyservers may even not
              even allow searching by user id or mail  address  and  thus  may
              only  return results when being used with the [1m--recv-key [22mcommand
              to search by key fingerprint or keyid.

       [1m--fetch-keys [4m[22mURIs[0m
              Retrieve keys located at the specified [4mURIs[24m. Note that different
              installations of GnuPG may support  different  protocols  (HTTP,
              FTP,  LDAP,  etc.).   When  using HTTPS the system provided root
              certificates are used by this command.

       [1m--update-trustdb[0m
              Do trust database maintenance. This command  iterates  over  all
              keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command
              because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys.
              The  user  has  to  give an estimation of how far she trusts the
              owner of the displayed key to  correctly  certify  (sign)  other
              keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet
              been  assigned to a key. Using the [1m--edit-key [22mmenu, the assigned
              value can be changed at any time.

       [1m--check-trustdb[0m
              Do trust database maintenance  without  user  interaction.  From
              time  to time the trust database must be updated so that expired
              keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust
              can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is  re‐
              quired and do it automatically unless [1m--no-auto-check-trustdb [22mis
              set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at
              any  time.  The  processing  is  identical  to that of [1m--update-[0m
              [1mtrustdb [22mbut it skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust".

              For use with cron jobs, this command can be used  together  with
              [1m--batch [22min which case the trust database check is done only if a
              check  is  needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the op‐
              tion [1m--yes[22m.

       [1m--export-ownertrust[0m
              Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for  backup
              purposes  as  these  values are the only ones which can't be re-
              created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example:
                  gpg --export-ownertrust > otrust.txt

       [1m--import-ownertrust[0m
              Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values  stored  in  [1mfiles[0m
              (or  STDIN  if  not given); existing values will be overwritten.
              In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have  a  recent
              backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file ‘[4motrust.txt[24m’),
              you may re-create the trustdb using these commands:
                  cd ~/.gnupg
                  rm trustdb.gpg
                  gpg --import-ownertrust < otrust.txt

       [1m--rebuild-keydb-caches[0m
              When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be
              used  to  create  signature  caches  in the keyring. It might be
              handy in other situations too.

       [1m--print-md [4m[22malgo[0m
       [1m--print-mds[0m
              Print message digest of algorithm [4malgo[24m for all  given  files  or
              STDIN.   With the second form (or a deprecated "*" for [4malgo[24m) di‐
              gests for all available algorithms are printed.

       [1m--gen-random [4m[22m0|1|2|16|30[24m [4mcount[0m
              Emit [4mcount[24m random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If
              [4mcount[24m is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random  bytes
              will be emitted.  If used with [1m--armor [22mthe output will be base64
              encoded.   The  special  level  16 uses a quality level of 1 and
              outputs an endless stream of hex-encoded  octets.   The  special
              level 30 outputs random as 30 zBase-32 characters.

       [1m--gen-prime [4m[22mmode[24m [4mbits[0m
              Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is subject to change
              with any release.

       [1m--enarmor[0m
       [1m--dearmor[0m
              Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII ar‐
              mor.   This  is  a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not
              very useful.  The [1m--dearmor [22mcommand can also be used to  dearmor
              PEM armors.

       [1m--unwrap[0m
              This  option modifies the command [1m--decrypt [22mto output the origi‐
              nal message with the encryption layer removed.  Thus the  output
              will  be  an  OpenPGP  data structure which often means a signed
              OpenPGP message.  Note that this option may or may not remove  a
              compression  layer  which  is often found beneath the encryption
              layer.

       [1m--tofu-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask} [4m[22mkeys[0m
              Set the TOFU policy for all the  bindings  associated  with  the
              specified  [4mkeys[24m.   For more information about the meaning of the
              policies, see: [trust-model-tofu].  The [4mkeys[24m  may  be  specified
              either by their fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.

   [1mHow to manage your keys[0m

       This section explains the main commands for key management.

       [1m--quick-generate-key [4m[22muser-id[24m [[4malgo[24m [[4musage[24m [[4mexpire[24m]]]
       [1m--quick-gen-key[0m
              This  is  a  simple  command to generate a standard key with one
              user id.  In contrast to [1m--generate-key [22mthe key is generated di‐
              rectly without the need to answer a bunch  of  prompts.   Unless
              the  option [1m--yes [22mis given, the key creation will be canceled if
              the given user id already exists in the keyring.

              If invoked directly on the console without any  special  options
              an  answer  to  a ``Continue?'' style confirmation prompt is re‐
              quired.  In case the user id already exists  in  the  keyring  a
              second prompt to force the creation of the key will show up.

              If  [4malgo[24m or [4musage[24m are given, only the primary key is created and
              no prompts are shown.  To specify an expiration date  but  still
              create  a  primary  and  subkey  use ``default'' or ``future-de‐
              fault'' for [4malgo[24m and ``default'' for [4musage[24m.  For  a  description
              of  these  optional  arguments  see the command [1m--quick-add-key[22m.
              The [4musage[24m accepts also the value ``cert'' which can be  used  to
              create  a  certification  only  primary key; the default is to a
              create certification and signing key.

              The [4mexpire[24m argument can be used to specify  an  expiration  date
              for  the  key.   Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO
              formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make
              the key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks,  N  months,  or  N
              years  use  ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' re‐
              spectively.  Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a
              key expiring in  a  reasonable  default  interval.   The  values
              ``never'', ``none'' can be used for no expiration date.

              If  this  command is used with [1m--batch[22m, [1m--pinentry-mode [22mhas been
              set  to  [1mloopback[22m,   and   one   of   the   passphrase   options
              ([1m--passphrase[22m,  [1m--passphrase-fd[22m,  or [1m--passphrase-file[22m) is used,
              the supplied passphrase is used for the new key  and  the  agent
              does  not  ask  for  it.  To create a key without any protection
              [1m--passphrase '' [22mmay be used.

              To create an OpenPGP key from the keys  available  on  the  cur‐
              rently  inserted  smartcard,  the special string ``card'' can be
              used for [4malgo[24m.  If the card features an encryption and a signing
              key, gpg will figure them out and creates an  OpenPGP  key  con‐
              sisting  of  the  usual  primary key and one subkey.  This works
              only with certain smartcards.  Note that the interactive [1m--full-[0m
              [1mgen-key [22mcommand allows one to do the same but with greater flex‐
              ibility in the selection of the smartcard keys.

              Note that it is possible to create a primary key  and  a  subkey
              using  non-default  algorithms by using ``default'' and changing
              the default parameters using the option [1m--default-new-key-algo[22m.

       [1m--quick-set-expire [4m[22mfpr[24m [4mexpire[24m [*|[4msubfprs[24m]
              With two arguments given, directly set the  expiration  time  of
              the  primary key identified by [4mfpr[24m to [4mexpire[24m.  To remove the ex‐
              piration time [1m0 [22mcan be used.  With three arguments and the third
              given as an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and
              not yet expired subkeys are set to [4mexpire[24m.  With more  than  two
              arguments and a list of fingerprints given for [4msubfprs[24m, all non-
              revoked subkeys matching these fingerprints are set to [4mexpire[24m.

       [1m--quick-add-key [4m[22mfpr[24m [[4malgo[24m [[4musage[24m [[4mexpire[24m]]]
              Directly  add  a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint
              [4mfpr[24m.  Without the optional arguments  an  encryption  subkey  is
              added.  If any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey
              is added.

              [4malgo[24m may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names given
              in the format as used by key listings.  To use the default algo‐
              rithm  the  string  ``default'' or ``-'' can be used.  Supported
              algorithms   are   ``rsa'',   ``dsa'',   ``elg'',   ``ed25519'',
              ``cv25519'',  and  other  ECC  curves.   For  example the string
              ``rsa'' adds an RSA key with the default key  length;  a  string
              ``rsa4096''  requests  that  the  key  length is 4096 bits.  The
              string ``future-default'' is an alias for  the  algorithm  which
              will  likely  be used as default algorithm in future versions of
              gpg.  To list the supported ECC curves the command  [1mgpg  --with-[0m
              [1mcolons --list-config curve [22mcan be used.

              Depending  on the given [4malgo[24m the subkey may either be an encryp‐
              tion subkey or a signing subkey.  If an algorithm is capable  of
              signing  and  encryption  and  such a subkey is desired, a [4musage[0m
              string must be given.  This  string  is  either  ``default''  or
              ``-''  to  keep  the default or a comma delimited list (or space
              delimited list) of keywords:  ``sign''  for  a  signing  subkey,
              ``auth''  for  an authentication subkey, and ``encr'' for an en‐
              cryption subkey (``encrypt'' can be used as alias for ``encr'').
              The valid combinations depend on the algorithm.

              The [4mexpire[24m argument can be used to specify  an  expiration  date
              for  the  key.   Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO
              formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make
              the key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks,  N  months,  or  N
              years  use  ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' re‐
              spectively.  Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a
              key expiring in  a  reasonable  default  interval.   The  values
              ``never'', ``none'' can be used for no expiration date.

              This command merely creates the revocation certificate  so  that
              it can be used to revoke the key if that is ever needed.  To ac‐

              be merged with the key to revoke.  This is done by importing the
              revocation certificate using the [1m--import [22mcommand.  Then the re‐
              voked key needs to be published, which is best done  by  sending
              the  key  to  a  keyserver (command [1m--send-key[22m) and by exporting

                     GnuPG does not select keys  via  attribute  user  IDs  so
                     these  preferences  will not be used by GnuPG.  Note that

                     When  setting preferences, you should list the algorithms
                     in the order which you'd like to see them used by someone
                     else when encrypting a message to your key.  If you don't
                     include 3DES, it will be automatically added at the  end.
                     Note that there are many factors that go into choosing an
                     algorithm  (for example, your key may not be the only re‐
                     cipient), and so the  remote  OpenPGP  application  being
                     used to send to you may or may not follow your exact cho‐
                     sen  order  for  a given message.  It will, however, only
                     choose an algorithm that is  present  on  the  preference
                     list of every recipient key.  See also the INTEROPERABIL‐

              Directly sign a key from the passphrase without any further user
              interaction.   The  [4mfpr[24m must be the verified primary fingerprint
              of a key in the local keyring. If no [4mnames[24m are given, all useful
              user ids are signed; with given [[4mnames[24m]  only  useful  user  ids
              matching  one  of  these  names are signed.  By default, or if a
              name is prefixed with a '*', a case insensitive substring  match
              is  used.  If a name is prefixed with a '=' a case sensitive ex‐

              The command [1m--quick-lsign-key [22mmarks the  signatures  as  non-ex‐

              need to update an existing signature,  for  example  to  add  or

              [1mkey[22m.

              This command uses reasonable defaults and thus does not  provide
              the  full  flexibility of the "sign" subcommand from [1m--edit-key[22m.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mgpg  [22mfeatures  a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to
       change the default configuration.

       Long   options   can   be   put   in   an   options    file    (default
       "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf").  Short  option names will not work - for example,
       "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a"  is  not.  Do
       not  write  the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any re‐
       quired arguments. Lines with a hash ('#') as the first  non-white-space
       character  are  ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that
       is not generally useful as the command will execute automatically  with
       every execution of gpg.

       Please  remember  that  option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is
       encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the  special  op‐
       tion [1m--[22m.

   [1mHow to change the configuration[0m

       These options are used to change the configuration and most of them are
       usually found in the option file.

              Use  [4mname[24m as the default key to sign with. If this option is not
              used, the default key is the  first  key  found  in  the  secret
              keyring.   Note  that  [1m-u [22mor [1m--local-user [22moverrides this option.
              This option may be given multiple times.  In this case, the last
              key for which a secret key is available is used.  If there is no
              secret key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will
              not emit an error message but continue as if this option  wasn't
              given.

       [1m--default-recipient [4m[22mname[0m
              Use  [4mname[24m as default recipient if option [1m--recipient [22mis not used
              and don't ask if this is a valid one. [4mname[24m must be non-empty.

       [1m--default-recipient-self[0m
              Use the default key as default recipient if  option  [1m--recipient[0m
              is  not  used  and don't ask if this is a valid one. The default
              key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with
              [1m--default-key[22m.

       [1m--no-default-recipient[0m
              Reset [1m--default-recipient [22mand [1m--default-recipient-self[22m.   Should

              Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow  interactive  commands.
              [1m--no-batch [22mdisables this option.  Note that even with a filename
              given  on  the  command  line, gpg might still need to read from
              STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached
              signature and no data file has been specified).  Thus if you  do
              not  want  to  feed  data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
              ‘[4m/dev/null[24m’.

              It is highly recommended to use this option along with  the  op‐
              tions  [1m--status-fd  [22mand  [1m--with-colons [22mfor any unattended use of

       [1m--no-tty[0m
              Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any  output.
              This  option  is  needed  in  some cases because GnuPG sometimes
              prints warnings to the TTY even if [1m--batch [22mis used.

              On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable

              acter  set of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not re‐
              code user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
              character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity
              level of 3 shows the chosen set.  This option should not be used

              Assume  that  command line arguments are given as UTF-8 strings.
              The default ([1m--no-utf8-strings[22m) is to assume that arguments  are

              These options affect all following arguments. Both  options  may
              be  used  multiple  times.  This option should not be used in an

              This option has no effect on Windows.  There the  internal  used
              UTF-8  encoding is translated for console input and output.  The
              command line arguments are expected as Unicode and translated to
              UTF-8.  Thus when calling this program from another,  make  sure
              to use the Unicode version of CreateProcess.

              Set compression level to [4mn[24m for the ZIP and ZLIB compression  al‐
              gorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of
              zlib  (normally  6). [1m--bzip2-compress-level [22msets the compression
              level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting  to  6  as
              well).  This  is  a different option from [1m--compress-level [22msince
              BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory  for  each  additional
              compression level.

              Option [1m-z [22msets both. A value of 0 for [4mn[24m disables compression.  A

              [1m--no-compress [22mis identical to [1m-z0[22m.

              This  alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but

              Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more  than

       [1m--default-cert-level [4m[22mn[0m
              The default to use for the check level when signing a key.

              0 means you make no particular claim as  to  how  carefully  you
              verified the key.

              1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to
              own it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This
              is  useful  for a "persona" verification, where you sign the key
              of a pseudonymous user.

              2 means you did casual verification of  the  key.  For  example,
              this  could  mean  that  you  verified  the  key fingerprint and
              checked the user ID on the key against a photo ID.

              3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For  example,
              this  could  mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the
              owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of  a
              hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that
              the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on the
              key,  and  finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that
              the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

              Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3  are  just
              that:  examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what
              "casual" and "extensive" mean to you.

              This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).

              When building the trust database, treat any  signatures  with  a

              stead of a fingerprint, all designated  options  previously  en‐
              countered  are discarded.  Designated revokers are marked on the
              key as non-revocable.  Note that a designated revoker  specified
              using a parameter file will also be added to the key.

                     TOFU stands for Trust On First Use.  In this experimental
                     trust  model,  the  first time a key is seen, it is memo‐
                     rized.  If later another key with a user id with the same
                     email address is seen, both keys are marked  as  suspect.
                     In  that case, the next time either is used, a warning is
                     displayed describing the conflict, why it might have  oc‐
                     curred (either the user generated a new key and failed to
                     cross sign the old and new keys, the key is forgery, or a
                     man-in-the-middle  attack  is  being  attempted), and the
                     user is prompted to manually confirm the validity of  the
                     key in question.

                     Because a potential attacker is able to control the email
                     address and thereby circumvent the conflict detection al‐
                     gorithm  by using an email address that is similar in ap‐
                     pearance to a trusted email address, whenever  a  message
                     is  verified,  statistics  about  the  number of messages
                     signed with the key are shown.  In this way, a  user  can
                     easily  identify attacks using fake keys for regular cor‐
                     respondents.

                     When compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers signifi‐
                     cantly weaker security guarantees.  In  particular,  TOFU
                     only  helps ensure consistency (that is, that the binding
                     between a key and email address doesn't change).  A major
                     advantage of TOFU is that it requires little  maintenance
                     to  use correctly.  To use the web of trust properly, you
                     need to actively sign keys and mark users as trusted  in‐
                     troducers.   This is a time-consuming process and anecdo‐
                     tal evidence suggests that even security-conscious  users
                     rarely  take  the  time to do this thoroughly and instead
                     rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.

                     In the TOFU model, policies are associated with  bindings
                     between  keys  and  email  addresses (which are extracted
                     from user ids and normalized).  There are five  policies,
                     which can be set manually using the [1m--tofu-policy [22moption.
                     The  default  policy can be set using the [1m--tofu-default-[0m
                     [1mpolicy [22moption.

                     The TOFU policies are: [1mauto[22m, [1mgood[22m, [1munknown[22m, [1mbad [22mand  [1mask[22m.
                     The  [1mauto [22mpolicy is used by default (unless overridden by
                     [1m--tofu-default-policy[22m) and marks a binding as  marginally
                     trusted.  The [1mgood[22m, [1munknown [22mand [1mbad [22mpolicies mark a bind‐
                     ing  as fully trusted, as having unknown trust or as hav‐
                     ing trust never, respectively.   The  [1munknown  [22mpolicy  is
                     useful  for  just  using TOFU to detect conflicts, but to
                     never assign positive trust to a binding.  The final pol‐
                     icy, [1mask [22mprompts  the  user  to  indicate  the  binding's
                     trust.  If batch mode is enabled (or input is inappropri‐
                     ate  in  the  context), then the user is not prompted and
                     the [1mundefined [22mtrust level is returned.

              [1mtofu+pgp[0m
                     This experimental trust model combines TOFU with the  Web
                     of  Trust.  This is done by computing the trust level for
                     each model and then taking the maximum trust level  where
                     the  trust levels are ordered as follows: [1munknown < unde‐[0m
                     [1mfined < marginal < fully < ultimate < expired < never[22m.

                     By setting [1m--tofu-default-policy=unknown[22m, this model  can
                     be  used  to  implement the web of trust with TOFU's con‐
                     flict detection algorithm, but without its assignment  of
                     positive  trust  values,  which  some  security-conscious

                     when changing to another trust model the trust values as‐
                     signed  to  a key are transformed into ownertrust values,

              The algorithm names given in the list  may  either  be  verbatim
              names like "ed25519" with an optional leading single equal sign,
              or being prefixed with ">", ">=", "<=", or "<".  That prefix op‐

              example 2048 in "rsa2048" or 384 in "brainpoolP384r1".   If  the
              the  leading non-digits in the name matches, the prefix operator
              is used to compare the number part, a trailing suffix is ignored
              in this case.  For example an algorithm list ">rsa3000, >=brain‐

              and on verification success that key is imported.

              the  option  [1mhonor-keyserver-url [22mis active (which is not the de‐
              fault), that keyserver is tried.  Note that the creator  of  the

              preferred keyserver for data signatures.

              3. If the  signature  has  the  Signer's  UID  set  (e.g.  using
              [1m--sender [22mwhile creating the signature) a Web Key Directory (WKD)
              lookup  is  done.   This is the default configuration but can be

              4. If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint  is
              part  of the signature (since GnuPG 2.1.16), the configured key‐
              servers are tried.

              Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior  possible.
              Keyserver  or Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you
              request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand  new  key
              (which  you  naturally will not have on your local keyring), the
              operator can tell both your IP address and  the  time  when  you
              verified the signature.

              are case-insensitive.

              Most  keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is gener‐
              ally no need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver
              [1mhkp://keys.gnupg.net [22muses round robin DNS to  give  a  different
              keyserver each time you use it.

       [1m--keyserver-options {[4m[22mname[24m=[4mvalue[24m}
              This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
              the  keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-' to give the
              opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may  be
              used  here as well to apply to importing ([1m--recv-key[22m) or export‐
              ing ([1m--send-key[22m) a key from a keyserver. While not  all  options
              are available for all keyserver types, some common options are:

              [1minclude-revoked[0m
                     When searching for a key with [1m--search-keys[22m, include keys
                     that  are  marked  on the keyserver as revoked. Note that
                     not all keyservers differentiate between revoked and  un‐
                     revoked  keys,  and  for  such  keyservers this option is
                     meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do  not  have
                     cryptographic  verification  of  key  revocations, and so
                     turning this option off may result in skipping keys  that
                     are incorrectly marked as revoked.

              [1minclude-disabled[0m
                     When searching for a key with [1m--search-keys[22m, include keys
                     that  are  marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that
                     this option is not used with HKP keyservers.

              [1mauto-key-retrieve[0m
                     This is an obsolete alias  for  the  option  [1mauto-key-re‐[0m
                     [1mtrieve[22m.   Please do not use it; it will be removed in fu‐
                     ture versions..

              [1mhonor-keyserver-url[0m
                     When using [1m--refresh-keys[22m, if the key in question  has  a
                     preferred  keyserver  URL,  then  use that preferred key‐
                     server to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-
                     retrieve is set, and the signature being verified  has  a
                     preferred  keyserver  URL,  then  use that preferred key‐
                     server to fetch the key from. Note that this  option  in‐
                     troduces a "web bug": The creator of the key can see when
                     the  keys  is refreshed.  Thus this option is not enabled
                     by default.

              [1minclude-subkeys[0m
                     When receiving a key, include subkeys as  potential  tar‐
                     gets.  Note  that  this  option is not used with HKP key‐
                     servers, as they do not support retrieving keys by subkey
                     id.

       The default list of options is: "self-sigs-only,  repair-keys,  repair-

       [1m--no-sig-cache[0m
              Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.  Caching
              gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if you
              suspect that your public keyring is not safe against write modi‐
              fications, you can use this option to disable  the  caching.  It
              probably  does  not make sense to disable it because all kind of
              damage can be done if someone else has write access to your pub‐
              lic keyring.

       [1m--auto-check-trustdb[0m
       [1m--no-auto-check-trustdb[0m
              If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of  Trust  has
              to be updated, it automatically runs the [1m--check-trustdb [22mcommand
              internally.   This  may  be a time consuming process. [1m--no-auto-[0m

              name.

              Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.

       [1m--no-autostart[0m
              Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
              started and its service is required.  This option is mostly use‐
              ful on machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been redi‐
              rected  to  another machines.  If dirmngr is required on the re‐
              mote machine, it may be started manually using [1mgpgconf  --launch[0m

       [1m--lock-never[0m
              Disable locking entirely. This option should  be  used  only  in
              very special environments, where it can be assured that only one
              process  is  accessing  those  files.  A  bootable floppy with a
              stand-alone encryption system will probably use  this.  Improper
              usage of this option may lead to data and key corruption.

       [1m--exit-on-status-write-error[0m
              This  option will cause write errors on the status FD to immedi‐
              ately terminate the process. That should in fact be the  default
              but  it  never worked this way and thus we need an option to en‐
              able this, so that the change  won't  break  applications  which
              close  their  end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using
              this option along with [1m--enable-progress-filter [22mmay be  used  to
              cleanly cancel long running gpg operations.

       [1m--limit-card-insert-tries [4m[22mn[0m
              With  [4mn[24m  greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a
              smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg  won't
              at  all  ask  to  insert  a  card  if  none has been inserted at
              startup. This option is useful in the configuration file in case
              an application does not know about  the  smartcard  support  and
              waits ad infinitum for an inserted card.

       [1m--no-random-seed-file[0m
              GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over invoca‐
              tions.   This  makes random generation faster; however sometimes
              write operations are not desired. This option  can  be  used  to
              achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.

              Suppress  the  warning  about  unsafe  file  and  home directory
              ([1m--homedir[22m) permissions. Note that the  permission  checks  that
              GnuPG  performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather
              they simply warn about certain common  permission  problems.  Do
              not  assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is
              secure.

              Note that the warning for unsafe [1m--homedir [22mpermissions cannot be
              suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker
              to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file  to
              suppress  warnings about itself. The [1m--homedir [22mpermissions warn‐
              ing may only be suppressed on the command line.

              keys that can sign.  Defaults  to  [1m--require-cross-certification[0m

       [1m--sender [4m[22mmbox[0m
              This  option  has  two purposes.  [4mmbox[24m must either be a complete
              user ID containing a proper mail address or just  a  plain  mail
              address.  The option can be given multiple times.

              When  creating  a  signature  this  option tells gpg the signing
              key's user id used to make the signature and embeds that user ID
              into the created signature (using OpenPGP's ``Signer's User ID''
              subpacket).  If the option is given multiple  times  a  suitable
              user  ID  is  picked.  However, if the signing key was specified
              directly by using a mail address (i.e. not by  using  a  finger‐
              print or key ID) this option is used and the mail address is em‐
              bedded in the created signature.

              When verifying a signature [4mmbox[24m is used to restrict the informa‐
              tion  printed by the TOFU code to matching user IDs.  If the op‐
              tion is used and the signature contains a ``Signer's  User  ID''
              subpacket  that  information  is  is  also  used to restrict the
              printed information.  Note that GnuPG considers  only  the  mail
              address part of a User ID.

              If  this  option  or  the  said subpacket is available the TRUST
              lines as printed by option [1mstatus-fd [22mcorrespond  to  the  corre‐
              sponding  User  ID;  if  no User ID is known the TRUST lines are
              computed directly on the key and do  not  give  any  information
              about the User ID.  In the latter case it his highly recommended
              to  scripts  and  other frontends to evaluate the VALIDSIG line,
              retrieve the key and print all User IDs along with their  valid‐
              ity (trust) information.

              trial decryption.  The key  set  with  [1m--default-key  [22mis  always
              tried  first, but this is often not sufficient.  This option al‐
              lows setting more keys to be used  for  trial  decryption.   Al‐
              though  any  valid user-id specification may be used for [4mname[24m it
              makes sense to use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities.
              Note that gpg-agent might pop up a pinentry for a lot keys to do
              the trial decryption.  If you want to stop all further trial de‐
              cryption you may use close-window button instead of  the  cancel
              button.

       [1m--try-all-secrets[0m
              Don't  look  at  the key ID as stored in the message but try all
              secret keys in turn to find the right decryption key.  This  op‐
              tion  forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (cre‐
              ated by using [1m--throw-keyids [22mor  [1m--hidden-recipient[22m)  and  might
              come  handy  in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus
              key ID.

       [1m--skip-hidden-recipients[0m
       [1m--no-skip-hidden-recipients[0m
              During decryption skip all anonymous  recipients.   This  option
              helps  in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature
              to hide their own encrypt-to key from others.  If one  has  many
              secret  keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys
              are tried in turn to decrypt something which was not really  in‐
              tended  for  it.  The drawback of this option is that it is cur‐
              rently not possible to decrypt a  message  which  includes  real
              anonymous recipients.

       [1m--max-output [4m[22mn[0m
              This option sets a limit on the number of  bytes  that  will  be
              generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various
              levels  of  compression,  it is possible that the plaintext of a
              given message may be  significantly  larger  than  the  original
              OpenPGP  message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages,
              there is often a desire to set a maximum file size that will  be
              generated  before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits.
              Defaults to 0, which means "no limit".

       [1m--chunk-size [4m[22mn[0m
              The AEAD encryption mode encrypts the data in chunks so  that  a
              receiving side can check for transmission errors or tampering at
              the  end of each chunk and does not need to delay this until all
              data has been received.  The used chunk size is 2^[4mn[24m  byte.   The
              lowest allowed value for [4mn[24m is 6 (64 byte) and the largest is the
              default of 22 which creates chunks not larger than 4 MiB.

       [1m--input-size-hint [4m[22mn[0m
              This  option  can be used to tell GPG the size of the input data
              in bytes.  [4mn[24m must be a positive base-10 number.  This option  is
              only  useful if the input is not taken from a file.  GPG may use
              this hint to optimize its buffer  allocation  strategy.   It  is
              also  used  by  the  [1m--status-fd  [22mline ``PROGRESS'' to provide a
              value for ``total'' if that is not available by other means.

       [1m--key-origin [4m[22mstring[24m[,[4murl[24m]
              gpg can track the origin of a key. Certain origins  are  implic‐
              itly  known  (e.g. keyserver, web key directory) and set.  For a
              standard import the origin of the keys imported can be set  with
              this option.  To list the possible values use "help" for [4mstring[24m.
              Some  origins  can store an optional [4murl[24m argument.  That URL can
              appended to [4mstring[24m after a comma.

       [1m--import-options [4m[22mparameters[0m
              This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for

              the opposite meaning. The options are:

              [1mimport-local-sigs[0m
                     Allow importing key signatures marked as "local". This is
                     not  generally  useful  unless a shared keyring scheme is
                     being used.  Defaults to no.

                     Normally possible still existing ownertrust values  of  a
                     key are cleared if a key is imported.  This is in general
                     desirable  so  that a formerly deleted key does not auto‐
                     matically gain an ownertrust values merely due to import.
                     On the other hand it is sometimes necessary to  re-import
                     a  trusted set of keys again but keeping already assigned
                     ownertrust values.  This can be achieved  by  using  this
                     option.

                     During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the
                     PKS  keyserver  bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys
                     with multiple subkeys. Note that this  cannot  completely
                     repair the damaged key as some crucial data is removed by
                     the  keyserver,  but  it  does at least give you back one
                     subkey. Defaults to no for regular [1m--import  [22mand  to  yes
                     for keyserver [1m--receive-keys[22m.

                     Show  a listing of the key as imported right before it is

                     to  only look at keys; the option [1mshow-only [22mis a shortcut
                     for this combination.  The command [1m--show-keys [22mis another
                     shortcut for this.  Note that suffixes like '#' for "sec"
                     and "sbb" lines may or may not be printed.

              [1mimport-export[0m
                     Run the entire import code but instead of storing the key
                     to the local keyring write it to the output.  The  export
                     option  [1mexport-dane  [22maffect  the output.  This option can
                     for example be used to remove all invalid  parts  from  a
                     key without the need to store it.

              [1mmerge-only[0m
                     During import, allow key updates to existing keys, but do
                     not allow any new keys to be imported. Defaults to no.

                     not usable.  Then, remove any signatures from the new key
                     that  are not usable.  This includes signatures that were
                     issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.  This
                     option  is  the  same  as  running the [1m--edit-key [22mcommand
                     "clean" after import. Defaults to no.

              [1mself-sigs-only[0m
                     Accept only self-signatures while importing a  key.   All
                     other  key  signatures  are  skipped  at  an early import
                     stage.  This option can be used with [1mkeyserver-options [22mto
                     mitigate attempts to flood a key  with  bogus  signatures
                     from  a  keyserver.  The drawback is that all other valid
                     key signatures, as required by the Web of Trust are  also
                     not  imported.   Note  that  when using this option along
                     with import-clean it suppresses the final clean step  af‐
                     ter merging the imported key into the existing key.

                     Note that an unprotected key is exported as-is  and  thus

                     OpenPGP encrypted file  still  applies  with  this  mode.
                     Versions  of  GnuPG  before  2.4.0 are not able to import

              quired evaluation of the status-line requires quite some effort;
              this  option  can  be  used  instead  to  make sure that the gpg
              process exits with a failure if the  compliance  rules  are  not
              fulfilled.   Note  that this option has currently an effect only
              in "de-vs" mode.

       [1m--faked-system-time [4m[22mepoch[0m
              This  option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
              back or forth to [4mepoch[24m which is the number  of  seconds  elapsed
              since the year 1970.  Alternatively [4mepoch[24m may be given as a full

              If  you  suffix  [4mepoch[24m  with an exclamation mark (!), the system

              armored messages or keys (see [1m--armor[22m). The default behavior  is
              not  to use a comment string. [1m--comment [22mmay be repeated multiple
              times to get multiple comment strings. [1m--no-comments [22mremoves all
              comments.  It is a good idea to keep the length of a single com‐
              ment below 60 characters to avoid problems  with  mail  programs
              wrapping  such  lines.   Note that comment lines, like all other
              header lines, are not protected by the signature.

              Put  the  name  value  pair into the signature as notation data.
              [4mname[24m must consist only of printable characters  or  spaces,  and
              must  contain  a  '@' character in the form keyname@domain.exam‐
              ple.com (substituting the appropriate keyname and  domain  name,
              of  course).   This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF re‐
              served notation namespace. The [1m--expert [22mflag overrides  the  '@'
              check.  [4mvalue[24m may be any printable string; it will be encoded in
              UTF-8, so you should check that your  [1m--display-charset  [22mis  set
              correctly.  If you prefix [4mname[24m with an exclamation mark (!), the
              notation data will be flagged  as  critical  (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).

              into the long key ID of the key being signed, "%f" into the fin‐
              gerprint of the key being signed, "%s" into the key  ID  of  the
              key  making  the signature, "%S" into the long key ID of the key
              making the signature, "%g" into the fingerprint of the key  mak‐
              ing  the signature (which might be a subkey), "%p" into the fin‐
              gerprint of the primary key of the  key  making  the  signature,
              "%c"  into  the  signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and
              "%%" results in a single "%". %k, %K, and %f are only meaningful
              when making a key signature  (certification),  and  %c  is  only
              meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.

              Adds  [4mname[24m to a list of known critical signature notations.  The
              effect of this is that gpg will not  mark  a  signature  with  a
              critical  signature notation of that name as bad.  Note that gpg
              already knows by default about a few critical  signatures  nota‐

              sion. "zip" is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is  used  by  PGP.
              "bzip2"  is  a  more modern compression scheme that can compress
              some things better than zip or zlib, but at  the  cost  of  more
              memory used during compression and decompression. "uncompressed"
              or  "none" disables compression. If this option is not used, the
              default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences  to
              see  which algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails,
              ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.

              ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as  the  com‐
              pression  window  size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even
              better compression results than that, but will  use  a  signifi‐
              cantly larger amount of memory while compressing and decompress‐
              ing.  This  may  be  significant in low memory situations. Note,
              however, that PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP  compression.
              Using  any algorithm other than ZIP or "none" will make the mes‐
              sage unreadable with PGP. In general, you do  not  want  to  use

              [1mkeyids [22mdisables this option. This option is essentially the same

       [1m--not-dash-escaped[0m
              This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that
              they  can  be  used for patch files. You should not send such an
              armored file via email because all spaces and line  endings  are
              hashed  too.  You  can  not use this option for data which has 5
              dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don't have  this.
              A  special  armor  header  line tells GnuPG about this cleartext

              Because some mailers change  lines  starting  with  "From  "  to
              ">From  "  it is good to handle such lines in a special way when
              creating cleartext signatures to prevent the  mail  system  from

       [1m--ignore-time-conflict[0m
              GnuPG  normally  checks that the timestamps associated with keys
              and signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a  sig‐
              nature  seems  to  be  older than the key due to clock problems.
              This option makes these checks just a warning.  See  also  [1m--ig‐[0m
              [1mnore-valid-from [22mfor timestamp issues on subkeys.

       [1m--ignore-valid-from[0m
              GnuPG  normally  does  not select and use subkeys created in the
              future.  This option allows the use of such keys  and  thus  ex‐
              hibits  the  pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option
              unless there is some clock problem. See also  [1m--ignore-time-con‐[0m

       [1m--ignore-crc-error[0m
              The  ASCII  armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum
              against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC  gets  mangled
              somewhere  on  the  transmission  channel but the actual content
              (which is protected by the OpenPGP  protocol  anyway)  is  still
              okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.

       [1m--ignore-mdc-error[0m
              This  option  changes  a MDC integrity protection failure into a
              warning.  It is required to decrypt old messages which  did  not
              use  an  MDC.   It  may also be useful if a message is partially
              garbled, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out
              of that garbled message.  Be aware that a missing or failed  MDC
              can  be an indication of an attack.  Use with great caution; see
              also option [1m--rfc2440[22m.

       [1m--allow-old-cipher-algos[0m
              Old cipher algorithms like 3DES, IDEA, or CAST5 encrypt data us‐
              ing blocks of 64 bits; modern algorithms use blocks of  128  bit
              instead.   To avoid certain attack on these old algorithms it is
              suggested not to encrypt more than 150  MiByte  using  the  same
              key.  For this reason gpg does not allow the use of 64 bit block
              size algorithms for encryption unless this option is specified.

       [1m--allow-weak-digest-algos[0m
              Signatures  made  with known-weak digest algorithms are normally
              rejected with an ``invalid digest algorithm'' message.  This op‐
              tion allows the verification of signatures made with  such  weak
              algorithms.  MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak by
              default.   See  also  [1m--weak-digest [22mto reject other digest algo‐
              rithms.

              Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.   Signatures  made
              over  weak digests algorithms are normally rejected. This option
              can be supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should  be
              considered  weak.  See also [1m--allow-weak-digest-algos [22mto disable
              rejection of weak digests.  MD5 is always considered  weak,  and

              To  avoid  a  minor risk of collision attacks on third-party key
              signatures made using SHA-1, those key signatures are considered

              This was a temporary introduced option and has no more effect.

       [1m--no-default-keyring[0m
              Do not add the default keyring to the  list  of  keyrings.  Note
              that  GnuPG  needs  for almost all operations a keyring. Thus if
              you use this option and do not provide  alternate  keyrings  via
              [1m--keyring[22m, then GnuPG will still use the default keyring.

              Note that if the option [1muse-keyboxd [22mis enabled in ‘[4mcommon.conf[24m’,
              no  keyrings  are used at all and keys are all maintained by the

       [1m--no-keyring[0m
              Do not use any keyring at all.  This overrides the  default  and

              signatures are not verified.  This command can be used to create
              a  list  of signing keys missing in the local keyring; for exam‐
              ple:

              achieved  by  leaving  some parts empty. Some applications don't
              need the user ID and the trust information given  in  the  list‐
              ings.  By  using this options they can get a faster listing. The

              messages ever encrypted for one secret key.

              You can also use this option if you receive an encrypted message
              which is abusive or offensive, to prove to the administrators of
              the messaging system that the ciphertext transmitted corresponds
              to an inappropriate plaintext so they can  take  action  against

              Set the list of default preferences to [4mstring[24m.  This  preference
              list  is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref"
              in the [1m--edit-key [22mmenu.

       [1m--default-keyserver-url [4m[22mname[0m
              Set the default keyserver URL to [4mname[24m. This  keyserver  will  be
              used as the keyserver URL when writing a new self-signature on a

              option is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to per‐
              form  tasks,  and  is  thus  not  generally useful. See the file
              ‘[4mdoc/DETAILS[24m’ in the source  distribution  for  the  details  of
              which  configuration  items may be listed. [1m--list-config [22mis only

              ternally used by the [1mgpgconf [22mtool.

       [1m--gpgconf-test[0m
              This is more or less dummy action.  However it parses  the  con‐
              figuration  file  and  returns with failure if the configuration
              file would prevent [1mgpg [22mfrom startup.  Thus it may be used to run
              a syntax check on the configuration file.

       [1m--chuid [4m[22muid[0m
              Change the current user to [4muid[24m which may either be a number or a
              name.  This can be used from the root account to run gpg for an‐
              other user.  If [4muid[24m is not the current UID a  standard  PATH  is
              set  and  the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter
              the option [1m--homedir [22mcan be used.  This option has only  an  ef‐
              fect  when  used on the command line.  This option has currently
              no effect at all on Windows.

[1mHOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID[0m
       There  are  different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them
       are only valid for [1mgpg [22mothers are only good for [1mgpgsm[22m.  Here is the en‐
       tire list of ways to specify a key:

       [1mBy key Id.[0m
              This format is deduced from the length of  the  string  and  its
              content or [1m0x [22mprefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the
              low  64  bits  of  its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids is
              just a shortcut, for all automated  processing  the  fingerprint
              should be used.

              When  using [1mgpg [22man exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
              using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try  and
              calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

              The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long
              form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the
              long key ID using the option [1m--with-colons[22m.

         0x234AABBCC34567C4

       [1mBy fingerprint.[0m
              This  format  is  deduced  from the length of the string and its
              content or the [1m0x [22mprefix.  Note, that only the 20  byte  version
              fingerprint  is available with [1mgpgsm [22m(i.e. the SHA-1 hash of the
              certificate).

              When using [1mgpg [22man exclamation mark (!) may be appended to  force
              using  the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
              calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

              The best way to specify a key Id is by  using  the  fingerprint.
              This  avoids  any  ambiguities in case that there are duplicated
              key IDs.

       [1m. and + prefixes[0m
              These prefixes are reserved for looking up mails anchored at the
              end  and  for  a word search mode.  They are not yet implemented
              and using them is undefined.

              Please note that we have reused the hash mark  identifier  which
              was  used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-
              id.  It is not anymore used and there should be no conflict when
              used with X.509 stuff.

              Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
              possible to map them back to the original encoding,  however  we
              don't  have  to do this because our key database stores this en‐
              coding as meta data.

[1mFILTER EXPRESSIONS[0m
       The options [1m--import-filter [22mand [1m--export-filter  [22muse  expressions  with
       this syntax (square brackets indicate an optional part and curly braces
       a repetition, white space between the elements are allowed):

                  [lc] {[{flag}] PROPNAME op VALUE [lc]}

       The  name  of a property ([4mPROPNAME[24m) may only consist of letters, digits
       and underscores.  The description for the filter type  describes  which
       properties  are defined.  If an undefined property is used it evaluates
       to the empty string.  Unless otherwise noted, the [4mVALUE[24m must always  be
       given  and  may not be the empty string.  No quoting is defined for the
       value, thus the value may not contain the strings [1m&& [22mor [1m||[22m,  which  are
       used  as  logical connection operators.  The flag [1m-- [22mcan be used to re‐
       move this restriction.

       Numerical values are computed as long int; standard C notation applies.
       [4mlc[24m is the logical connection operator; either [1m&& [22mfor a  conjunction  or
       [1m||  [22mfor a disjunction.  A conjunction is assumed at the begin of an ex‐
       pression.  Conjunctions have higher precedence than  disjunctions.   If
       [4mVALUE[24m  starts  with  one of the characters used in any [4mop[24m a space after
       the [4mop[24m is required.

       The supported operators ([4mop[24m) are:

       [1m=~     [22mSubstring must match.

       [1m!~     [22mSubstring must not match.

       [1m=      [22mThe full string must match.

       [1m-f     [22mAlias for "PROPNAME == 0" (no value allowed).

       Values for [4mflag[24m must be space separated.  The supported flags are:

       [1m--     [4m[22mVALUE[24m spans to the end of the expression.

       [1m-c     [22mThe string match in this part is done case-sensitive.

       [1m-t     [22mLeading and trailing spaces are not removed from [4mVALUE[24m.  The op‐
              tional single space after [4mop[24m is here required.

       The filter options concatenate several specifications for a  filter  of
       the same type.  For example the four options in this example:

                 --import-filter keep-uid="uid =~ Alfa"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="&& uid !~ Test"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="|| uid =~ Alpha"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="uid !~ Test"

       which is equivalent to

                 --import-filter \
                  keep-uid="uid =~ Alfa" && uid !~ Test" || uid =~ Alpha" && "uid !~ Test"

       imports  only  the  user  ids of a key containing the strings "Alfa" or
       "Alpha" but not the string "test".

       Trust values are used to indicate ownertrust and validity of  keys  and
       user IDs.  They are displayed with letters or strings:

       [1m-[0m
       [1munknown[0m
              No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.

       [1me[0m
       [1mexpired[0m

              Trust calculation has failed; probably due to an expired key.

       [1mq[0m
       [1mundefined, undef[0m
              Not enough information for calculation.

       [1mn[0m
       [1mnever  [22mNever trust this key.

       [1mm[0m
       [1mmarginal[0m
              Marginally trusted.

       [1mf[0m
       [1mfull   [22mFully trusted.

       [1mu[0m
       [1multimate[0m
              Ultimately trusted.

       [1mr[0m
       [1mrevoked[0m
              For validity only: the key or the user ID has been revoked.

       [1m?[0m
       [1merr    [22mThe program encountered an unknown trust value.

[1mFILES[0m
       There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of [1mgpg[22m's
       operation.  Unless  noted, they are expected in the current home direc‐
       tory (see: [option --homedir]).

       [1mgpg.conf[0m
              This is the standard configuration file read by [1mgpg [22mon  startup.
              It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes may
              not  be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This de‐
              fault name may be changed on the command line (see:  [gpg-option
              --options]).  You should backup this file.

       [1mcommon.conf[0m
              This  is  an optional configuration file read by [1mgpg [22mon startup.
              It may contain options pertaining to all  components  of  GnuPG.
              Its  current  main  use is for the "use-keyboxd" option.  If the
              default home directory ‘[4m~/.gnupg[24m’ does not exist, GnuPG  creates
              this directory and a ‘[4mcommon.conf[24m’ file with "use_keyboxd".

       Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined files
       into the directory ‘[4m/etc/skel/.gnupg[24m’ so that newly created users start
       up  with  a  working  configuration.  For existing users a small helper
       script is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).

       For internal purposes [1mgpg [22mcreates and maintains a few other files; They
       all live in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).  Only
       the [1mgpg [22mprogram may modify these files.

       [1m~/.gnupg[0m
              This is the default home directory which is used if neither  the
              environment  variable  [1mGNUPGHOME  [22mnor  the  option  [1m--homedir [22mis
              given.

       [1m~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg[0m
              The public keyring using a legacy  format.   You  should  backup
              this file.

              If  this  file  is not available, [1mgpg [22mdefaults to the new keybox
              format and creates a file ‘[4mpubring.kbx[24m’ unless that file already
              exists in which case that file will also  be  used  for  OpenPGP
              keys.

              Note  that  in the case that both files, ‘[4mpubring.gpg[24m’ and ‘[4mpub‐[0m
              [4mring.kbx[24m’ exists but the latter has no OpenPGP keys, the  legacy
              file  ‘[4mpubring.gpg[24m’ will be used.  Take care: GnuPG versions be‐
              fore 2.1 will always use the file ‘[4mpubring.gpg[24m’ because they  do
              not  know about the new keybox format. In the case that you have
              to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data you should  keep  this
              file.

       [1m~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock[0m
              The lock file for the public keyring.

       [1m~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx[0m
              The  public  keyring  using the new keybox format.  This file is
              shared with [1mgpgsm[22m.  You should backup this file.  See above  for
              the relation between this file and it predecessor.

              To  convert an existing ‘[4mpubring.gpg[24m’ file to the keybox format,
              you first  backup  the  ownertrust  values,  then  rename  ‘[4mpub‐[0m
              [4mring.gpg[24m’  to  ‘[4mpublickeys.backup[24m’, so it won’t be recognized by
              any GnuPG version, run import,  and  finally  restore  the  own‐
              ertrust values:

         $ cd ~/.gnupg
         $ gpg --export-ownertrust >otrust.lst
         $ mv pubring.gpg publickeys.backup
         $ gpg --import-options restore --import publickeys.backup
         $ gpg --import-ownertrust otrust.lst

       [1m~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock[0m
              The lock file for ‘[4mpubring.kbx[24m’.

       [1m~/.gnupg/secring.gpg[0m
              The  legacy secret keyring as used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.
              It is not used by GnuPG 2.1 and later.  You may want to keep  it
              in case you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data.

       [1m~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock[0m
              The lock file for the legacy secret keyring.

       [1m~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated[0m
              File indicating that a migration to GnuPG 2.1 has been done.

       [1m~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg[0m
              The trust database.  There is no need to backup this file; it is
              better  to  backup the ownertrust values (see: [option --export-
              ownertrust]).

       [1m~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock[0m
              The lock file for the trust database.

       [1m~/.gnupg/random_seed[0m
              A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool.

       [1m~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/[0m
              This is the directory where gpg stores pre-generated  revocation
              certificates.   The file name corresponds to the OpenPGP finger‐
              print of the respective key.  It is suggested  to  backup  those
              certificates and if the primary private key is not stored on the
              disk to move them to an external storage device.  Anyone who can
              access these files is able to revoke the corresponding key.  You
              may want to print them out.  You should backup all files in this
              directory and take care to keep this backup closed away.

       Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables:

       [1mHOME   [22mUsed to locate the default home directory.

       [1mGNUPGHOME[0m
              If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

       [1mGPG_AGENT_INFO[0m
              This  variable is obsolete; it was used by GnuPG versions before
              2.1.

       [1mPINENTRY_USER_DATA[0m
              This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry.  It is useful to
              convey extra information to a custom pinentry.

       [1mCOLUMNS[0m
       [1mLINES  [22mUsed to size some displays to the full size of the screen.

       [1mLANGUAGE[0m
              Apart from its use by GNU, it is used  in  the  W32  version  to
              override  the  language selection done through the Registry.  If
              used and set to a valid and available  language  name  ([4mlangid[24m),
              the    file    with    the    translation    is    loaded   from
              [4mgpgdir[24m/gnupg.nls/[4mlangid[24m.mo.  Here [4mgpgdir[24m is the directory out of
              which the gpg binary has been loaded.  If it can't be loaded the
              Registry is tried and as last resort the native  Windows  locale
              system is used.

       [1mGNUPG_BUILD_ROOT[0m
              This  variable  is  only  used by the regression test suite as a
              helper under operating systems without proper support to  figure
              out the name of a process' text file.

       [1mGNUPG_EXEC_DEBUG_FLAGS[0m
              This  variable allows one to enable diagnostics for process man‐
              agement.  A numeric decimal value is expected.   Bit  0  enables
              general diagnostics, bit 1 enables certain warnings on Windows.

       When  calling  the  gpg-agent  component [1mgpg [22msends a set of environment
       variables to gpg-agent.  The names of these variables can be listed us‐
       ing the command:

           gpg-connect-agent 'getinfo std_env_names' /bye | awk '$1=="D" {print $2}'

[1mNOTES[0m
       [1mgpg [22mis often used as a backend engine by other software.  To help  with
       this a machine interface has been defined to have an unambiguous way to
       do  this.   The  options  [1m--status-fd [22mand [1m--batch [22mare almost always re‐
       quired for this.

   [1mProgrammatic use of GnuPG[0m

       Please consider using GPGME instead of calling [1mgpg [22mdirectly.  GPGME of‐
       fers a stable, backend-independent interface for many cryptographic op‐
       erations.  It supports OpenPGP and S/MIME, and also allows  interaction
       with various GnuPG components.

       GPGME  provides  a  C-API,  and  comes  with  bindings for C++, Qt, and
       Python.  Bindings for other languages are available.

   [1mEphemeral home directories[0m

       Sometimes you want to contain effects of some  operation,  for  example
       you want to import a key to inspect it, but you do not want this key to
       be  added to your keyring.  In earlier versions of GnuPG, it was possi‐
       ble to specify alternate keyring files for both public and secret keys.
       In modern GnuPG versions, however,  we  changed  how  secret  keys  are
       stored  in  order to better protect secret key material, and it was not
       possible to preserve this interface.

       The preferred way to do this is  to  use  ephemeral  home  directories.
       This technique works across all versions of GnuPG.

       Create  a  temporary  directory,  create (or copy) a configuration that
       meets your needs, make [1mgpg [22muse this directory either using the environ‐
       ment variable [4mGNUPGHOME[24m, or the option [1m--homedir[22m.  GPGME supports  this
       too  on  a per-context basis, by modifying the engine info of contexts.
       Now execute whatever operation you like, import and export key material
       as necessary.  Once finished, you can delete the directory.  All  GnuPG
       backend services that were started will detect this and shut down.

   [1mThe quick key manipulation interface[0m

       Recent  versions  of GnuPG have an interface to manipulate keys without
       using the interactive command [1m--edit-key[22m.   This  interface  was  added
       mainly  for  the benefit of GPGME (please consider using GPGME, see the
       manual subsection ``Programmatic use of GnuPG'').   This  interface  is
       described in the subsection ``How to manage your keys''.

   [1mUnattended key generation[0m

       The  command  [1m--generate-key  [22mmay be used along with the option [1m--batch[0m
       for unattended key generation.  This is the most flexible way of gener‐
       ating keys, but it is also the most complex one.   Consider  using  the
       quick  key  manipulation interface described in the previous subsection
       ``The quick key manipulation interface''.

       The parameters for the key are either read from stdin  or  given  as  a
       file  on the command line.  The format of the parameter file is as fol‐
       lows: Text only, line length  is  limited  to  about  1000  characters.
       UTF-8  encoding  must  be  used to specify non-ASCII characters.  Empty
       lines are ignored.  Leading and trailing white  space  is  ignored.   A
       hash  sign  as  the first non white space character indicates a comment
       line.  Control statements are indicated  by  a  leading  percent  sign,
       their arguments are separated by white space from the keyword.  Parame‐
       ters  are  specified  by  a keyword, followed by a colon; arguments are
       separated by white space.  The first parameter must be  ‘Key-Type’  but
       control statements may be placed anywhere.  The order of the parameters
       does  not  matter  except for ‘Key-Type’.  The parameters are only used
       for the generated keyblock (primary and subkeys); parameters from  pre‐
       vious  sets  are  not  used.  Some syntax checks may be performed.  Key
       commences when either the end of the parameter  file  is  reached,  the
       next  ‘Key-Type’  parameter  is  encountered,  or the control statement
       ‘%commit’ is encountered.

       Control statements:

       [1m%echo [4m[22mtext[0m
              Print [4mtext[24m as diagnostic.

       [1m%dry-run[0m
              Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax checking).

       [1m%commit[0m
              Perform the key generation.  Note that  an  implicit  commit  is
              done at the next  parameter.

       [1m%pubring [4m[22mfilename[0m
              Do not write the key to the default or commandline given keyring
              but  to [4mfilename[24m.  This must be given before the first commit to
              take place, duplicate specification of the same filename is  ig‐
              nored,  the last filename before a commit is used.  The filename
              is used until a new filename is used (at commit points) and  all
              keys  are written to that file. If a new filename is given, this
              file is created (and overwrites an existing one).

              See the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories'' for a
              more robust way to contain side-effects.

       [1m%secring [4m[22mfilename[0m
              This option is a no-op for GnuPG 2.1 and later.

              See the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories''.

       [1m%ask-passphrase[0m
       [1m%no-ask-passphrase[0m
              This option is a no-op since GnuPG version 2.1.

       [1m%no-protection[0m
              Using this option  allows  the  creation  of  keys  without  any
              passphrase  protection.   This option is mainly intended for re‐
              gression tests.

       [1m%transient-key[0m
              If given the keys are created using a faster and a somewhat less
              secure random number generator.  This option  may  be  used  for
              keys  which  are  only  used for a short time and do not require
              full cryptographic strength.  It takes only effect if  used  to‐
              gether with the control statement ‘%no-protection’.

       General Parameters:

       [1mKey-Type: [4m[22malgo[0m
              Starts  a  new parameter block by giving the type of the primary
              key. The algorithm must be capable of signing.  This  is  a  re‐
              quired  parameter.  [4malgo[24m may either be an OpenPGP algorithm num‐
              ber or a string with the algorithm name.  The special value ‘de‐
              fault’ may be used for [4malgo[24m to create the default key  type;  in
              this case a ‘Key-Usage’ shall not be given and ‘default’ also be
              used for ‘Subkey-Type’.

       [1mKey-Length: [4m[22mnbits[0m
              The  requested length of the generated key in bits.  The default
              is returned by running the command  ‘gpg  --gpgconf-list’.   For
              ECC keys this parameter is ignored.

       [1mKey-Curve: [4m[22mcurve[0m
              The  requested  elliptic  curve of the generated key.  This is a
              required parameter for ECC keys.   It  is  ignored  for  non-ECC
              keys.

       [1mKey-Grip: [4m[22mhexstring[0m
              This  is  optional and used to generate a CSR or certificate for
              an already existing key.  Key-Length will be ignored when given.

       [1mKey-Usage: [4m[22musage-list[0m
              Space or comma delimited list of key usages.  Allowed values are
              ‘encrypt’, ‘sign’, and ‘auth’.  This is used to generate the key
              flags.  Please make sure that the algorithm is capable  of  this
              usage.  Note that OpenPGP requires that all primary keys are ca‐
              pable  of  certification, so no matter what usage is given here,
              the ‘cert’ flag will be on.  If no ‘Key-Usage’ is specified  and
              the  ‘Key-Type’  is  not  ‘default’, all allowed usages for that
              particular algorithm are used; if it is not given but  ‘default’
              is used the usage will be ‘sign’.

       [1mSubkey-Type: [4m[22malgo[0m
              This  generates  a  secondary  key (subkey).  Currently only one
              subkey can be handled.  See also ‘Key-Type’ above.

       [1mSubkey-Length: [4m[22mnbits[0m
              Length of the secondary key (subkey) in bits.   The  default  is
              returned by running the command ‘gpg --gpgconf-list’.

       [1mSubkey-Curve: [4m[22mcurve[0m
              Key curve for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Curve’.

       [1mSubkey-Usage: [4m[22musage-list[0m
              Key usage lists for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Usage’.

       [1mPassphrase: [4m[22mstring[0m
              If you want to specify a passphrase for the secret key, enter it
              here.   Default  is  to  use  the  Pinentry  dialog to ask for a
              passphrase.

       [1mName-Real: [4m[22mname[0m
       [1mName-Comment: [4m[22mcomment[0m
       [1mName-Email: [4m[22memail[0m
              The three parts of a user name.  Remember to use UTF-8  encoding
              here.  If you don't give any of them, no user ID is created.

       [1mExpire-Date: [4m[22miso-date[24m|([4mnumber[24m[d|w|m|y])
              Set  the  expiration  date for the key (and the subkey).  It may
              either be entered in ISO date format (e.g. "20000815T145012") or
              as number of days, weeks, month  or  years  after  the  creation
              date.  The special notation "seconds=N" is also allowed to spec‐
              ify  a  number of seconds since creation.  Without a letter days
              are assumed.  Note that there is no check done on  the  overflow
              of  the  type  used  by OpenPGP for timestamps.  Thus you better
              make sure that the given value  make  sense.   Although  OpenPGP
              works  with  time intervals, GnuPG uses an absolute value inter‐
              nally and thus the last year we can represent is 2105.

       [1mCreation-Date: [4m[22miso-date[0m
              Set the creation date of the key as stored in the  key  informa‐
              tion and which is also part of the fingerprint calculation.  Ei‐
              ther   a  date  like  "1986-04-26"  or  a  full  timestamp  like
              "19860426T042640" may be used.  The time  is  considered  to  be
              UTC.   The  special notation "seconds=N" may be used to directly
              specify a the number of seconds since Epoch (Unix time).  If  it
              is not given the current time is used.

       [1mPreferences: [4m[22mstring[0m
              Set the cipher, hash, and compression preference values for this
              key.   This  expects  the same type of string as the sub-command
              ‘setpref’ in the [1m--edit-key [22mmenu.

       [1mRevoker: [4m[22malgo[24m:[4mfpr[24m [sensitive]
              Add a designated revoker to the generated key.  Algo is the pub‐
              lic key algorithm of the designated revoker (i.e. RSA=1, DSA=17,
              etc.)  [4mfpr[24m is the fingerprint of the  designated  revoker.   [4mfpr[0m
              may not contain spaces or colons.  The optional ‘sensitive’ flag
              marks  the designated revoker as sensitive information.  Only v4
              and v5 keys may be designated revokers.

       [1mKeyserver: [4m[22mstring[0m
              This is an optional parameter that specifies the preferred  key‐
              server URL for the key.

       [1mHandle: [4m[22mstring[0m
              This  is  an  optional parameter only used with the status lines
              KEY_CREATED and KEY_NOT_CREATED.  [4mstring[24m may be up to 100  char‐
              acters  and  should  not contain spaces.  It is useful for batch
              key generation to associate a key parameter block with a  status
              line.

       Here  is  an example on how to create a key in an ephemeral home direc‐
       tory:
         $ export GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)"
         $ cat >foo <<EOF
              %echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
              Key-Type: DSA

              Subkey-Length: 1024

              # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
              %commit
              %echo done
         EOF
         $ gpg --batch --generate-key foo
          [...]
         $ gpg --list-secret-keys
         /tmp/tmp.0NQxB74PEf/pubring.kbx

       If you want to create a key with the default algorithms you  would  use
       these parameters:
              %echo Generating a default key
              Key-Type: default
              Subkey-Type: default

              # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
              %commit
              %echo done

[1mBUGS[0m
       On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
       is  necessary  to  lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the
       operating  system  from  writing  memory  pages  (which   may   contain
       passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning
       message  about  insecure  memory your operating system supports locking
       without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked
       memory is allocated.

       Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have  the  ability  to
       ``suspend  to  disk''  (also known as ``safe sleep'' or ``hibernate'').
       This writes all memory to disk before going into a low  power  or  even
       powered off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system to
       protect  the  saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may
       be recoverable from it later.

       Before you report a bug  you  should  first  search  the  mailing  list
       archives  for  similar problems and second check whether such a bug has
       already been reported to our bug tracker at [1mhttps://bugs.gnupg.org[22m.
